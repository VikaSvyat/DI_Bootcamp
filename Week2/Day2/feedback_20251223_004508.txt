suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 1: The message is slightly different from the original
- Exercise 6: Adding ' the Great ' adds extra spaces at the end of the magician's name.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises were completed successfully and meet all the requirements, with small issues on exercise 1 and 6. Exercise 1 - The message is slightly different from the original request. Exercise 6 - The final output has an extra space
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to understand. Consistent indentation and meaningful variable names improve readability.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs well for the given tasks. There are no unnecessary loops or computations.
- security: The code is secure. User input is validated for Exercise 4, and there are no apparent vulnerabilities.
