suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a docstring to the `longest_word` function to explain its purpose and parameters.
- For the first challenge, use the `input()` function to take the string from the user.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses both challenges. The first challenge sorts comma-separated words alphabetically, and the second identifies the longest word in a sentence, exactly as specified in the chapter content.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive. Comments could be more elaborate but are present.
- performance: The code has good performance for the given tasks. The sorting algorithm and longest word identification are efficient for the expected input sizes.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external input that could create security vulnerabilities in this context.
