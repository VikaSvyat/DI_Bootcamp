# # Exercise 3: Dogs Domesticated
# Create a class called PetDog that inherits from the Dog class.
# Add a trained attribute to the __init__ method, with a default value of False.
# Implement a train() method that prints the output of bark() and sets trained to True.
# Implement a play(*args) method that prints “<dog_names> all play together”.
# *args on this method is a list of dog instances.
# Implement a do_a_trick() method that prints a random trick if trained is True.
# Use this list for the ramdom tricks:
# tricks = ["does a barrel roll", "stands on his back legs", "shakes your hand", "plays dead"]
# Choose a random index from it each time the method is called.


# Step 3: Test PetDog Methods

# Create instances of the PetDog class and test the train(), play(*args), and do_a_trick() methods.
