suggestions for improvement:
- The `__init__` method takes a word as input, which is not ideal. The word to check should be passed to the `get_anagrams` or `is_valid_word` methods instead.
- The `is_valid_word` method should take a word as an argument, not rely on the instance variable `self.word`.
- Consider moving the file reading operation outside the class or caching the word list for better performance, especially if multiple `AnagramChecker` instances are created.
- Remove the commented-out test code from the class definition.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `AnagramChecker` class needs to be implemented in a separate file as instructed.
- The AnagramChecker class should be instantiated once, before the loop, rather than inside the loop
- The `show_menu` function mixes input gathering, validation, and processing; consider separating these concerns for better modularity.
- The message 'this is a valid English word' should be conditional based on the result of the `is_valid_word` method call.
- The code does not load the word list into the anagram checker class as instructed.
- The code currently calls AnagramChecker() incorrectly. the user input is passed to the init, but is supposed to be the file to be loaded.

suggestions for improvement:
- This looks like the content of `sowpods.txt` and not code.
- This is a zip file's content, but not in the right format.
- This file needs to be extracted from the zip file, then saved as txt file, because the function requires text file as argument.
